# To-Do List Application
A simple, interactive To-Do List application built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created as a part of my learning and practice to enhance my skills in JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Features
* Add Tasks: Create tasks dynamically using the input field and the "Add Task" button or by pressing the Enter key.
* Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list with a delete button for each task.
* Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout using Tailwind CSS, ensuring it works seamlessly on different screen sizes.
* Interactive Effects: Hover and focus effects for buttons and tasks.
* Smooth transitions and subtle scaling animations for better user experience.

## Technologies Used
* HTML: Markup for structuring the application.
* Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for designing and styling the user interface.
* JavaScript: Logic for adding and removing tasks dynamically.
